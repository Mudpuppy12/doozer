Restful API task execution using echo and machinery in golang

This is a POC that will hopefully expand into something more useful. Goal is to create a resetful api that can trigger defined tasks to execute. The execution will issue an in in which api calls can querry the status of the job/task.

POC will be based off echo framework and the machinery framework.
